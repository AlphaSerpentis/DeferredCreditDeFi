# Deferred Credit for DeFi

DeFi has heavily used overcollateralized loans, and for good reason. Unsecured credit present a clear risk to the lender with no current way of offering guaranteed protection to the lender and some form of punishment to the borrower.

Deferred credit, however, is a secured credit type that enables the borrower to not immediately pay for an asset. This can open the possibility to where an account is not needed to be overcollateralized. The collateral in the account will be 100%, as long as the vendor (lender/seller) accepts the deferred credit and collateral.
